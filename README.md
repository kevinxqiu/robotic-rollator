# Robotic Rollator Velocity Estimation

Different filtering techniques are compared for lateral velocity estimation of a robotic rollator. Data has been collected via IMU, encoder and VICON measurements. The main components of this project evaluates the following:

* Integration Method
* Temporal Convolution Network
* Extended Kalman Filter
* TCN + EKF/KF
* TCN + UKF
